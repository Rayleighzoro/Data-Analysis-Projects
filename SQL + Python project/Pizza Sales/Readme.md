# Pizza Sales Data Analysis
This project showcases a complete data analysis pipeline, combining `Python's` robust data preprocessing with `SQL's` powerful analytical capabilities. It transforms raw pizza order data into actionable business intelligence, demonstrating an end-to-end workflow.

## Pizza Store Sales Analysis and Visualization
This project analyzes **sales data from a pizza store** to uncover key insights into revenue, customer preferences, and sales trends. The goal is to provide **data-driven insights** that help understand ordering patterns, best-selling pizzas, and overall business performance. The analysis leverages **Python for data preprocessing and SQL for data extraction and transformation**.

## Key Features of the Analysis and Visualization

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Total Revenue**: Overall earnings from pizza sales.
- **Average Order Value**: Insights into customer spending per order.
- **Total Pizzas Sold**: The total number of pizzas purchased.
- **Total Orders**: The number of orders placed.
- **Average Pizzas Per Order** : Understanding order sizes and customer preferences.

### Charts and Visualizations
- **Orders by Day**: Identifying peak ordering days.
- **Orders by Month**: Analyzing seasonal sales trends.
- **Sales Percentage by Pizza Category**: Comparing different pizza categories.
- **Sales Percentage by Pizza Size**: Evaluating the popularity of various sizes.
- **Top 5 Pizzas by Revenue**: Identifying the highest-grossing pizzas.
- **Top 5 Pizzas by Quantity**: Tracking the best-selling pizzas.
- **Top 5 Pizzas by Orders**: Understanding the most frequently ordered pizzas.

### üõ† Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For data loading, cleaning, and preprocessing.
- **SQL**: For data extraction, transformation, and analysis.
- **Power BI**: For dynamic dashboards and visualizations.

### üéØ Benefits of the Project
- **Business Insights**: Helps store owners optimize their menu and pricing strategy.
- **Customer Preferences**: Identifies top-selling pizzas and preferred sizes.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Supports better inventory management and demand forecasting.
